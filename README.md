# Weekendschool-Borduren-Embroidery
Les Programmeer je Borduurwerk met TurtleStitch

This repository holds the material for the lesson "Programmeer je Borduurwerk" (Program your embroidery) that is to be given at the Weekendschool Eindhoven (https://www.weekendschooleindhoven.nl/) in December 2025.

This lesson is part of the class on Fashion.

We will program the embroidery using TurtleStitch (https://turtlestitch.org/) in offline mode and then via USB sticks transfer it to embroidery machines.
